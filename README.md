# sshd-shell-spring-boot
This artifact is a spring boot starter that provides SSH access to spring boot applications. It is primarily designed for  developers who want to roll out custom shell commands for various purposes.

The motivation for this starter was due to the fact that spring-boot had officially dropped support for spring-boot-starter-remote-shell for the 2.x versions.

This starter has been tested with spring-boot 2.0.0.M4 till 2.0.x.RELEASE with support its new endpoint infrastructure. For supporting the older spring boot versions, please see the git branch 1.5.x which supports 1.5.x right up to 2.0.0.M3 for more information.

To import into Maven project, add the following dependency inside `pom.xml`:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.anand1st</groupId>
        <artifactId>sshd-shell-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
        <version>3.5</version>
    </dependency>
    
For Gradle users, add these lines inside `build.gradle`:

    dependencies {
        compile group: 'io.github.anand1st', name: 'sshd-shell-spring-boot-starter', version: '3.5'
    }

### Note
Versions < 2.1 are deprecated and unsupported. The artifact above supports the following functionalities:

### Version 3.5
Modified SshdShellProperties to add the properties 

    sshd.filetransfer.enabled
    sshd.filesystem.base.dir
Added also username into SshSessionContext that can be accessed via

    SshSessionContext.get(Constants.USER)
With these changes, one can now figure out the rooted filesystem for a session user by autowiring SshdShellProperties into the custom command classes to access the sshd.filesystem.base.dir property and by the session username.

### Version 3.4
Support for SFTP and SCP with configurable Root File System. Upgraded jline to 3.7.0. See Usage section below for properties to be set. Tested with OSX only. Usage:

    sftp -P 8022 admin@localhost
    scp -P 8022 <localFile> admin@localhost:<filename> 
	
### Version 3.3
Adheres to the management enabled endpoint for actuators. If the endpoint is enabled/disabled, the ssh command likewise is enabled/disabled according to this setting.

### Version 3.2.1
Support for spring boot 2.0.0.RC1, 2.0.0.RC2 and 2.0.0.RELEASE.
Upgraded to jline 3.6.0 and sshd-core 1.7.0.
Minor code fixes and refactorings.

##### Please do not use version 3.2 as there seems to be some Jackson incompatibilities on Linux. Version 3.2.1 fixes these issues.

### Version 3.1
Added support for SSH exec in addition to SSH shell.

### Version 3.0
Only for spring boot versions 2.0.0.M4 and (hopefully) above.
Added support for spring boot 2.0.0.M4 endpoint infrastructure which is very different from versions below this.

### Version 2.5
Supports spring boot versions from 1.5.x till 2.0.0.M3 (tested for these versions only).
Upgraded to jline-3.5.1.
Added support for highlighting of response output based on searched text using postprocessors (highlighting tested on OSX).
Added support for the emailing response output using postprocessors.
Examples of post processors can be seen below.

### Version 2.4
Upgraded to jline-3.4.0. Refactored I/O related activity from SshSessionContext to ConsoleIO. Separated console processing into separate packages from SSH server packages.

### Version 2.3
Support for auto-completion of commands and subcommands using tab.

### Version 2.2
Fixed bug with prompt & text color.

### Version 2.1
Support for role-based access control using spring-security's `AuthenticationProvider` bean. `SshdShellCommand` annotation includes a 'roles' parameter (defaults to * denoting permission to all commands) which should use spring-security's role tag if `sshd.shell.authType=AUTH_PROVIDER` and spring-security is in the classpath. If a user's role matches the roles in the command classes, he/she should be able to execute the command. 

Every user session has a session context which a developer can use to manage state between command invocations

# Usage
All the developer needs to do it to create a class similar to below and make sure it's loaded by the Application Context:

    @Component
    @SshdShellCommand(value = "echo", description = "Echo by users. Type 'echo help' for supported subcommands")
    public class EchoCommand {
    
        @SshdShellCommand(value = "bob", description = "Bob's echo. Usage: echo bob <arg>")
        public String bobSays(String arg) throws IOException {
	        ConsoleIO.writeOutput("Need user info");
            String name = ConsoleIO.readInput("What's your name?");
            SshSessionContext.put("name", name);
            return "bob echoes " + arg + " and your name is " + name;
        }
    
        @SshdShellCommand(value = "alice", description = "Alice's echo. Usage: echo alice <arg>")
        public String aliceSays(String arg) {
            String str = "";
            if (SshSessionContext.containsKey("name")) {
                str = ", Name " + SshSessionContext.get("name") + " exists";
            }
            return "alice says " + arg + str;
        }
	
	    @SshdShellCommand(value = "admin", description = "Admin's echo. Usage: echo admin <arg>", roles = "ADMIN")
	    public String adminSays(String arg) {
	        return "admin says " + arg;
	    }
    }

Supported properties in application.properties (defaults are as below):

    sshd.shell.port=8022			#Set to 0 for random port
    sshd.shell.enabled=false		#Set this to true to startup SSH daemon
    sshd.shell.username=admin
    sshd.shell.password= 			#A random string is generated if password is not set and shown in logs
    sshd.shell.publicKeyFile=
    sshd.shell.host=127.0.0.1		#Allowed IP addresses
    sshd.shell.hostKeyFile=hostKey.ser
    sshd.shell.prompt.title=app
    
    # Supported values for colors: BLACK,RED,GREEN,YELLOW,BLUE,MAGENTA,CYAN,WHITE (leave blank for default)
    sshd.shell.prompt.color=           # Defaults to BLACK
    sshd.shell.text.color=             # Defaults to BLACK
    sshd.shell.text.highlightColor=    # Defaults to YELLOW
    sshd.shell.auth.authType=SIMPLE		# Possible values: SIMPLE, AUTH_PROVIDER
    sshd.shell.auth.authProviderBeanName=	# Bean name of authentication provider if authType is AUTH_PROVIDER (optional)
    sshd.filetransfer.enabled=true          # Defaults to false. Must be enabled for SCP and SFTP functionality
    sshd.filesystem.base.dir=/home/app      # Defaults to 'user.home' property
    
When spring-boot-actuator is included, `HealthIndicator` classes in classpath will be loaded. The 'health' command will show all `HealthIndicator` components. Developers can also write their own custom `HealthIndicator` classes for loading. It's important that the names of these custom classes end with the suffix `HealthIndicator` to be loaded by the application.

To connect to the application's SSH daemon (the port number can found from the logs when application starts up):

    ssh -p <port> <username>@<host>

If public key file is used for SSH daemon:

    ssh -p <port> -i <privateKeyFile> <username>@<host>

For more information, check out the sshd-shell-spring-boot-test-app project for a fully working example.

Limitations:
1) Currently, every method must return a java.lang.String (shell output) and take in exactly one java.lang.String parameter (denoting nullable arguments in shell command).
2) Requires minimum JDK 8.
